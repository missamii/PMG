# PMG
HTML5 &amp; CSS3 Animation Ad for PMG.

I was given a .PSD file to work with. Here is what I came up with for an Ad Animation.
[CodePen Demo](https://codepen.io/tiffanylo/pen/VyNoYL?editors=1100)

## My Process
 - Take the provided .PSD file and convert it to .SVG.
 - Break each part of the .SVG into classes or id, as needed.
 - Use CSS3, keyframes to animate.
